# BackpackAPI
[![MyGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/BackpackWebAPI.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BackpackWebAPI)

Library meant to provide clean methods and classes between your app and backpack.tf's own API.

## Want to try it out for yourself while I develop it?
Sure thing! Just clone the repository, open it up in VS, and add in your own [backpack.tf API key](https://backpack.tf/developer/apikey/view) as shown below in `BackpackWebAPITester/Program.cs`, line 16:

Then simply debug, step over (or through, if that's your thing) the different API calling methods, and see what kind of data you get! Feel free to change the method call parameters to test things out and see if any bugs are found - *please* make an issue or PR if you see one!
